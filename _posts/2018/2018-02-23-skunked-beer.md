It has very little to do with temperature and everything to do with light. It was first documented by Dr. Carl Linter in the 1875 Lehrbuch der Bierbrauerei, but an explanation for the phenomenon wasn't presented [until 2001 by Burns et al](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1521-3765%2820011105%297%3A21%3C4553%3A%3AAID-CHEM4553%3E3.0.CO%3B2-0). This formally identified light as the culprit and documented the mechanism.

In beer brewed with hops, there are compounds that give us bitterness, shelf stability via anti-bacterial properties, and contribute to foam formation and head retention. These compounds are produced by the isomerization of the alpha acids in the hops, which occurs during the boil. The isomerization produces several new species of trans- and cis-iso-alpha acids and it is these new compounds which are very sensitive to light - both visible and ultraviolet.

Light causes breakdown of these iso-alpha acids, which, in the presence of other molecules in the beer (riboflavin, ascorbic acid, and aminos that contain sulfur) results in the formation of a compound called 3-methyl-but-2-ene-1-thiol (3MBT). This new compound is very similar to the one that skunks are famous for. It has a flavor/odor threshold of only a few parts per trillion, making it very noticeable.

This can be avoided through canning and to some degree by using brown glass bottles. If the beer is being served in glassware, however, it will be exposed to light. To further combat skunking, brewers can either reduce the presence of iso-alpha-acids or replace some of the high alpha acid hops in the recipe with tetra hop extracts, which, while still photosensitive, don't result in the formation of some of the components necessary for the production of 3MBT. The compounds that do form aren't nearly as offensive and are usually masked by the other flavors and odors of the beer.
