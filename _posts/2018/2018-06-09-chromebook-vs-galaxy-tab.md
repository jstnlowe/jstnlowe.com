As with almost any other consumer product, the internet is full of in-depth reviews of Samsung’s [Chromebook Plus ](http://amzn.to/2D2PfEv)and their [Galaxy Tab S3](http://amzn.to/2D131HT). They go in to agonizing detail. The smallest shortcoming is pronounced a catastrophic design flaw that, the reviewers assure us, will bankrupt Samsung and single-handedly bring about the complete economic destruction of South Korea. Often, the authors celebrate the most minor differences (it’s silver and not black!) in order to pronounce one of them the second coming of Christ. It’s absurd. Here's my attempt at not being absurd.

I’ll skip over the specs (you can Google them), the speculation about repairability (be honest: you don’t even know what a soldering iron looks like), the marginal differences in real-world performance (but, but benchmarks!), and the pitchfork-waving over the price difference (these are luxury goods, not canned goods). All that matters is where the device fits in your life, and there are two considerations: workflow and ecosystem.

And, just so you know that my opinion is super credible, I’ll tell you that I’ve been using both devices for a whole month. Every day. For work, for travel (I took them to a different country, just for you), and for watching old episodes of Top Gear.

# Ecosystem
Stick with one ecosystem. Less fragmentation and less complexity means more time and energy for watching cat videos. If you own an iPhone or a Macbook, just get an iPad Pro. If you own an Android phone or you’ve willingly surrendered your privacy in bits and pieces to Google in return for access to all their neat services, get one of these. Quit wasting neurons on re-learning tools on a different OS or worrying about how to sync your iCloud to Google Drive and vice-versa. Unless your job involves that sort of thing, in which case get one of each device (and a Surface Pro for good measure) and bill it to your employer.

# Workflow
Everyone has fantasies, from time to time, of sitting in a coffee shop reading some intellectually-dense eBook, taking elegant notes while sipping an elegant latte, or whipping out their tablet and making a quick sketch while sitting on the bus or train or plane or whatever. Unless you’re already doing that stuff, just get that out of your head. These devices will not magically transform your life just like buying fancy gym clothes will not make you go to the gym. They are tools, not magical catalysts for change. If you buy either of them hoping for that to happen, you’re just going to be remorsefully eBaying them later on. Pick the one that will replace or improve on the things you’re already doing.

# Conclusions
The [Chromebook Plus](http://amzn.to/2D2PfEv) is for you if:

- You don’t own a laptop (or your laptop never leaves the desk)
- You occasionally want to take some notes or pretend you’re an artist
- You like to force people to watch cat videos with you
- You want the look and feel of a desktop OS

The [Galaxy Tab S3](http://amzn.to/2D131HT) is for you if:

- You want to try to go paperless
- Stylus comfort is more important than writing emails
- You don’t like watching stuff with other people
- You’re willing to pay a premium for a bit of elegance

If you buy the CB+, keep in mind that the S3 stylus works great with it (aside from the button and the hover functionality), but you better get some serious note-taking mileage out of it because [it’s expensive](http://amzn.to/2D0dLGs).

If you get the Tab S3, skip the Samsung keyboard cover. It’s expensive and you’re not going to use it anywhere near enough to justify the cost. [Buy this one instead](http://amzn.to/2FVPjce). It has magnets and transforms the tablet from a fragile sheet of glass into something akin to a riot shield.
