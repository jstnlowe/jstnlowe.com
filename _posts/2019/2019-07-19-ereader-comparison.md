Quick mock-up comparing the sizes of [Onyx Boox Note Pro](https://amzn.to/2JQMQSR) and the [Nova Pro](https://amzn.to/2JRlFHF). I like the idea of a ereader with a stylus, especially one that runs Android and sports a Wacom digitizer. Trying to decide if the Nova would be too small - if the Note is really worth the premium price. Both are awesome devices, just need to choose portability versus ergonomics.
