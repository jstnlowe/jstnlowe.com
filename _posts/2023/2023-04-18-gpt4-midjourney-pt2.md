Again, using GPT4 to generate concise prompts for specific concepts.

GPT4 Prompt: In the form of a 100-word prompt suitable for use with an AI image generator: describe the exterior architecture and features of an ideal small, modern cabin in the woods.

GPT4 Response: Design a cozy, modern cabin nestled in a lush forest. Incorporate a minimalist exterior with clean lines, floor-to-ceiling windows, and natural materials like wood and stone. Include a sloping green roof, an outdoor deck, and subtle exterior lighting. Situate the cabin on a serene clearing surrounded by tall trees, with a meandering footpath leading to its entrance.
